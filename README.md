# Nand2Tetris
Projects of the Nand2Tetris course described in https://www.nand2tetris.org/course

## Summary of projects:
####- Project 1: Boolean Logic
Built logic gates, like And, Not, Or, Xor, Dmux, and so on, sing primitive NAND gates and the composite gates gradually built on top of them
####- Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic
Built an ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) for the Hack computer, using all the gates of the previous projects and other combinational chips built upon them, like HalfAdder, FullAdder, Add16...
####- Project 3: Sequential Logic
Built a Program Counter and RAM units of different size (up to 16K), using Registers designed with primitive DFF gates and the chips constructed in the previous projects
####- Project 4: Machine Language
